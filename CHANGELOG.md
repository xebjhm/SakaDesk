## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-16

### Added
- Multi-service architecture — sync and view multiple services simultaneously
- First-launch onboarding flow with login carousel and sequential sync
- Per-service inline sync progress view (replaces empty-state confusion)
- Global fuzzy search across messages and blogs with keyword highlighting
- Blog feature with full-text search, member filtering, and media gallery
- Blog full backup with parallel downloading and background processing
- Internationalization (i18n) with 5 languages: English, Japanese, Traditional Chinese, Simplified Chinese, Cantonese
- Service-themed UI with per-group color schemes and ambient backgrounds
- Yodel service support
- Member favorites and custom service/feature ordering via drag-and-drop
- Adaptive sync with smart timing based on posting patterns
- Desktop notification support (hidden until stable)
- In-app update checker with version comparison
- DPI-aware window geometry save/restore
- Search index with reader-writer executor split for concurrent access
- Settings UI with blog backup status, sync interval, and output folder picker
- About dialog with diagnostics and issue reporting
- Session expiration detection with automatic re-login prompt
- Comprehensive test suites: backend (83 tests), frontend (Vitest), E2E (Playwright)

### Changed
- Auth/sync flow follows pyhako CLI pattern with TokenManager integration
- FastAPI lifecycle migrated from deprecated `on_event` to `lifespan` context manager
- Folder picker uses async executor instead of blocking thread.join
- PriorityPool replaced with per-operation TCPConnector limits
- Structured logging uses keyword args instead of f-strings throughout
- Requires pyhako >= 0.2.0

### Fixed
- XSS vulnerability in search result snippets — now sanitized with DOMPurify
- Internal exception details no longer leaked in HTTP 500 responses
- `metadata_file` initialized in SyncService `__init__` with runtime guard
- `member_ids` query parameter validates integer conversion (400 vs 500)
- DPI scaling drift on window geometry save/restore
- Sync works immediately after re-login (no restart required)
- Session expiration properly redirects to login

### Security
- Search snippets sanitized with DOMPurify (ALLOWED_TAGS: mark only)
- HTTP 500 responses return generic message, full errors logged server-side
- Structured logging prevents credential leakage via f-strings
